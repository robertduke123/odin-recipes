    <h3>A delicious Sweet Potatoe Muffin</h3>
    <p>This is how we clean out the vegetable bin! You can add pretty much any veggies that you like to this red coconut curry. We've made this with shrimp instead of chicken, added apples, used spinach and zucchini... Have fun! Also, the seasoning quantities are on the "light" side. If you like your seasonings as we do, double them! It's the seasonings and coconut milk that make it. This can be served as a soup/stew, or with brown rice (our fave!), or quinoa.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
